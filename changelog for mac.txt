rtklib in mac
1. when compile rnx2rtkp in mac (Xcode, Clion, gcc, or whatever)ï¼Œit says "cant find -lrt library". 
Just remove the argument -lrt in the makefile. In clang(mac), runtime lib is not explicitly needed, while in Linux it is needed.

2. After successful complilation, run rnx2rtkp, it will show an error: Segmental fault 11. The solution is to change in the 
first line of rtkcmn.c as follows: change "#define _POSIX_C_SOURCE 199309" to "#define _POSIX_C_SOURCE 199506"
